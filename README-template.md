## üí° My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS custom properties** (variables)  
- **Flexbox** for layout alignment  
- **Mobile-first** responsive design  
- **@font-face** for custom font import (Figtree)  

---

### What I learned

During this challenge, I improved my understanding of:

- Structuring semantic HTML using `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>`.
- Creating clean and consistent layouts using Flexbox.
- Using CSS custom properties (`:root`) to maintain color consistency.
- Implementing hover effects with smooth transitions.
- Adding subtle shadows and rounded corners to create depth and hierarchy.

Here‚Äôs an example of the hover effect I implemented on the title:

```css
.text .headline {
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  color: var(--Gray-950);
  transition: 0.2s;
}

.text .headline:hover {
  color: var(--Yellow);
}
